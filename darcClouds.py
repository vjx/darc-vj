""" Simple 'sprite' images are moved towards the camera position to give the
illusion of movement through clouds, uses the uv_flat shader to simply show
the image with no lighting effect, blend is set to True so that parts of the
image with alpha less than 1 are merged with the images already drawn but
further from the camera. Because of this it is important that the clouds are
drawn from furthest to nearest (the opposite to opaque objects)
